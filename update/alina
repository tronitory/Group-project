The application is web-based interface that visualises existing data of Airtable using gantt chart view and might be accessible through 
calendar view as well. To be able to pull existing data to interface, we should utilise Airtable API. The application should allow user to 
zoom in and out to each day, month, year views and timeline should be infinite. The application should allow colour coded booking status 
selection (booked, confirmed, pending,…). Client would prefer if we use iCal API for interface. The application should allow a dynamic 
calendar that we will embed on client’s website to allow users to see available time slots. The application must allow you to select what 
information is available to website users.
